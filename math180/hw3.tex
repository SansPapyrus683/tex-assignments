\section{Chapter 5.1}

\begin{enumerate}
      \item[6] The proof is by induction.
      For $n=2$, there's only one possible tree and it has two leaves,
      so $p_1=2$ and the proposition is satisfied.
      Assuming truth for $n$, we now try to prove the validity of the statement for $n+1$.

      By what was proved in class, we can construct any tree with $n+1$ nodes
      just by adding a leaf to an existing tree with just $n$ nodes.
      Suppose the node we add the leaf onto has degree $d$.

      Notice that adding a leaf to this node increases its degree by $1$,
      so now $p_d$ decreases by $1$ and $p_{d+1}$ increases by $1$.
      By how we defined the summation, this makes the overall
      sum on the RHS decrease by $1$, since
      \[-(d-2)p_d-(d-1)p_{d+1}=-(d-2)(p_d-1)-(d-1)(p_{d+1}+1)+1\]

      However, we still have to add the leaf, which
      does nothing but increase $p_1$ and the total sum by $1$.
      The decrement and the increment balance each other out,
      so no matter what the sum of the expression stays at $2$. $\square$

\section{Chapter 5.2}

\begin{enumerate}
      \item[2] Although the two trees below have the same degree sequence,
      they aren't isomorphic since the "junctions" are at a different distance from each other.
      \begin{center}
            \includegraphics[width=10cm]{img/hw3/same_score}
      \end{center}

      \item[6] Represent each tree with the $01$-encoding taught in class.
      Each node contributes two characters to the string, so let's just
      stupidly consider all binary strings of length $2n$.
      Each character has two possible values, so there's $2^{2n}=4^n$ encodings.
      Though not all of them are valid, we're just trying to prove
      an upper bound here. $\square$
\end{enumerate}
