i am in dire need of stuff to do over winter break

so here's my solutions to the homework problems on
[this site](https://mathdept.byu.edu/~nick/ucla/132/)

i don't really wanna check them against the solution manual,
so these could be horribly wrong for all i know

stopped in the middle of hw 4 because school started lol
